# WK 1 CODE CHALLENGE : INTERACTIVE SHOPPING LIST

## Prerequisites:

- Develop a webpage with a shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

### Requirements:

- Array: Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.

### DOM Manipulation:

### Event Handling:

- Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
